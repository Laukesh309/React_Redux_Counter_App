Overview
===========
there are four major pprtion in redux which is used in react
1.Action
2.Reducer
3.Store

1.package required for redux configure in react are :
    1. redux
    2. react-redux
    3. @reduxjs/toolkit (because previous we are using createStore which is import from react-redux but now it is deprecated so Instead of createStore we will use configureStore which is imported from @reduxjs/toolkit)


    Issue We Have Faced While Creating This App
    ==============================================
1. In configureStore reducer key is mondatory which value is assign allReducer(check in index.js Store Folder)
2. state should be immutable in every changes so every time new state value should return . you we are using array as state then return array with spread operator
if you are using array of object the do deep copy of every field even inside of object also . so for deep copy use string.parse(string.stringify()) method

Redux Component Overview
===========================

1.Action : It is besically a function which return  an object which define what we have to perform. in return object type property is mondatory other than this we can use
other property according to our need

2. Reducer : It is also a function in which two parameter is mondatory (state and action) we have to define initial state in defoult value of state parameter
   and we have to change state according to the action.type . for this we use switch case which is same as action function return
  Note: State must be immutable

in both Action and Reducer no need to add any package from redux . it is just like normal function

3. Store : it is not any user define funtion or object . it is a general some calling funtion which is imported from redux like
   if reducer is more than one then we use combineReducer ({

   })
   syntax like  :
    let allReducer=combineReducer({
      counter:couterReducer
    })
  then send this
  const store = configureStore({
    reducer:allReducer /// here reducer key is mondatory . eror will throw if we not define key
  })

now by above line of code store is ready

4.  provider : it is imported from react-redux package . it will  we wrapped at the top level of componet and sent store as props from provier componet
   Now Store will available to every place in child componet


Now To GetState of Store
===========================
1. import {useSelector,useDispatch} from  "react-redux"

  to get perticular reducer state value use syntax like this:
   const state = useSelector(state=>state.counter)
2.  to dispatch any action use useDispatch hook in which pass action function defined in action filenames
    const dispatch = useDispatch()

    <button  onClick=()=>{
      dispatch(increment())
    }/>

Note
======
we can create multiple reducer funtion according to our need
